				<h2>Creator of elegant handmade illustrations that help clients tell sophisticated stories</h2>
																																								

						<h3>Work</h3>

						<p>My distinctive illustrations have been used for everything from wine labels to children’s books, from portraits for Macy’s to maps for The New York Times. My career is centered around designing for real people, no matter the medium or platform. </p>

						<h3>Process</h3>

						<p>The loosest sketches often germinate my best ideas. Research and sketching form the base for polished drawings, made with everything near my fingertips: ink, paint, (more) toothbrushes, and a wacom tablet. The final art clearly reflects an illustrator’s hand, but is digital in presentation and flexibility. </p>

				


						<h3>About</h3>

(read more)  Co-founding BumpBump Books led me into the realm of designing for mobile devices, while a recent degree in UX reinforced my love of research and human centered design. </p>
